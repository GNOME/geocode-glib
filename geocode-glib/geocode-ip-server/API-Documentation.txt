1. What does the server do?

The server performs IP address and Wi-Fi based geolocation search.

2. How to set up the server?

After building geocode-glib, you will get a geoip-lookup binary that
you can install as a cgi-bin script inside your web server, or use
the test application ("launch-web-server.sh") as below.

$ ./launch-web-server.sh start - to start the server
$ ./launch-web-server.sh stop - to stop the server

The script will set up the server at your http://localhost:12345.

And the URL will be - http://localhost:12345/cgi-bin/geoip-lookup

3. How should one query the server for IP address based Geolocation search?

There are 2 ways -

a. You can provide a query string in the format of "?ip=<IP address>". After
installing the server at your localhost using the script, you can use -

   http://localhost:12345/cgi-bin/geoip-lookup?ip=123.23.23.23

b. If you do not provide the query string, the server will autodetect
the client's external IP address.

If you have used launch-web-server.sh script to launch the server, the script
sets HTTP_CLIENT_IP (one of the many proxy variables checked by the server to
guess client's IP address) and thus a simple
http://localhost:12345/cgi-bin/geoip-lookup works.

4. How should one query the server for Wi-Fi based geolocation search?

The query string should be in the format of -

?wifi=mac:<mac address>|ssid:<ssid>|ss:<signal strength>[&...]

The server installed by the script at your localhost can be queried using the
following URL -

http://localhost:12345/cgi-bin/geoip-lookup?wifi=mac:01-24-7c-bc-51-46%7Cssid:3x2x%7Css:-37&wifi=mac:09-86-3b-31-97-b2%7Cssid:belkin.7b2%7Css:-47&wifi=mac:28-cf-da-ba-be-13%7Cssid:HERESIARCH%20NETWORK%7Css:-49&wifi=mac:2b-cf-da-ba-be-10%7Cssid:%20ARCH%20GUESTS%7Css:-52&wifi=mac:08-56-3b-2b-e1-a8%7Cssid:belkin.1a8%7Css:-59&wifi=mac:02-1e-64-fd-df-67%7Cssid:Brown%20Cow%7Css:-59&wifi=mac:2a-cf-df-ba-be-10%7Cssid:%20ARCH%20GUESTS%7Css:-59

5. What is the output format of the server?

The server provides Geolocation information in JSON format.

An IP address based query would return -

{"ip":"123.23.23.23","latitude":10.25,"longitude":105.96669769287109,
"country_name":"Vietnam","country_code":"VN","region_name":"Phu Yen",
"city":"Vinh Long","accuracy":"city","timezone":"Asia/Phnom_Penh",
"attribution":"This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind,
 available from http://www.maxmind.com\n"}

An Wi-Fi based query would return -

{"latitude":40.060449299999988,"longitude":-105.2094195,"accuracy":24}

6. What are the possible error scenarios and error messages?

The server gives the following errors in the following cases -

a. Invalid IP address -
{"error_code":0, "error_message":"Invalid IP address '123.23.23'"}

b. Reserved IP address -
{"error_code":1, "error_message":"Can not find the IP address '127.0.0.1' in the
database"}

c. Database not found by the server -
{"error_code":2, "error_message":"Can not open GeoLiteCity/GeoIP Binary database.
Set GEOIP_DATABASE_PATH env variable."}

The error codes in the JSON output shown above are enum values.

typedef enum {
        INVALID_IP_ADDRESS_ERR = 0,
        INVALID_ENTRY_ERR,
        DATABASE_ERR
} GeoipServerError;

They are defined in
https://git.gnome.org/browse/geocode-glib/tree/geocode-glib/geocode-ip-server/geoip-server.h
