geocode-glib is a convenience library for the geocoding (finding longitude,
and latitude from an address) and reverse geocoding (finding an address from
coordinates). It uses Nominatim service to achieve that. It also caches
(reverse-)geocoding requests for faster results and to avoid unnecessary server
load.

Requirements
------------

geocode-glib requires json-glib, gio and libsoup to compile and run.

While geocode-glib can be compiled against libsoup version 2.x or version 3.x, as
those versions can't cohabit in the same binary, you will need to choose which
one your application will support, especially if geocode-glib isn't a direct
dependency. Version 1.0 of the geocode-glib API only supports libsoup 2.x,
version 2.0 (and later) of the API will only support libsoup 3.x.
